/**
 * Sentry Team Member resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as sentry from "@pulumiverse/sentry";
 *
 * // Add a member to a team
 * const defaultSentryOrganizationMember = new sentry.SentryOrganizationMember("defaultSentryOrganizationMember", {
 *     organization: "my-organization",
 *     email: "test@example.com",
 *     role: "member",
 * });
 * const defaultSentryTeam = new sentry.SentryTeam("defaultSentryTeam", {
 *     organization: "my-organization",
 *     slug: "my-team",
 * });
 * const defaultSentryTeamMember = new sentry.SentryTeamMember("defaultSentryTeamMember", {
 *     organization: "my-organization",
 *     team: defaultSentryTeam.id,
 *     memberId: defaultSentryOrganizationMember.internalId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * import using the member ID and team slug from the URL:
 *
 * https://[org-slug].sentry.io/settings/teams/[team-slug]/members/
 *
 * https://[org-slug].sentry.io/settings/members/[member-id]/
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import sentry:index/sentryTeamMember:SentryTeamMember default org-slug/team-slug/member-id
 * ```
